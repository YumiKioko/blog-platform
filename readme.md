# Blog Platform - Microservices Architecture

A fully functional blog platform built with React frontend and microservices architecture. All services are containerized with Docker and working properly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd blog-platform
   ```

2. **Start all services with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Wait for services to start** (takes 1-2 minutes for all health checks to pass)
   ```bash
   # Check service status
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - 🌐 **Frontend**: http://localhost
   - 🔐 **Auth Service API**: http://localhost:3001
   - 📝 **Posts Service API**: http://localhost:3002
   - 📊 **Analytics Service API**: http://localhost:3003

### Stopping the Application
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (cleans up data)
docker-compose down -v
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Rebuild a specific service after changes
docker-compose build frontend
docker-compose up -d frontend

# View logs for a service
docker-compose logs frontend
docker-compose logs auth-service

# Restart a specific service
docker-compose restart auth-service
```

## 📊 Services Status

- ✅ **Frontend**: React app running on port 80
- ✅ **Auth Service**: JWT authentication on port 3001  
- ✅ **Posts Service**: Blog posts management on port 3002
- ✅ **Analytics Service**: Usage analytics on port 3003
- ✅ **MongoDB**: Database on port 27017
- ✅ **Redis**: Caching on port 6379

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js Express services
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Analytics**: Python Flask
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Web Server**: Nginx (reverse proxy)

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Auth Service (3001)
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/health` - Health check

### Posts Service (3002)  
- `GET /api/posts` - Get all posts
- `POST /api/posts` - Create new post
- `GET /api/posts/health` - Health check

### Analytics Service (3003)
- `GET /api/analytics/health` - Health check

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ User authentication with JWT
- ✅ Blog post creation and management  
- ✅ Redis caching for performance
- ✅ Analytics service for usage tracking
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ React frontend with routing
- ✅ Nginx reverse proxy with API routing

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT tokens (set in docker-compose.yml)
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `REDIS_URI`: Redis connection string
- `PORT`: Service port configuration

## 🔧 Health Checks

All services include health endpoints that are monitored by Docker:
- http://localhost:3001/health
- http://localhost:3002/health  
- http://localhost:3003/health

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services show "unhealthy" status:**
```bash
# Wait longer for initial startup (services have 40s start period)
docker-compose ps

# Check logs for specific service
docker-compose logs auth-service
```

**Port conflicts:**
- Ensure ports 80, 3001, 3002, 3003, 27017, and 6379 are available

**Rebuild services:**
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

**Check container status:**
```bash
# List all containers with status
docker-compose ps

# View detailed container information
docker-compose logs
```

### Database Access
```bash
# Access MongoDB shell
docker-compose exec mongodb mongosh

# Access Redis CLI
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli
```
